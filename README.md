## Troubleshooting Authentication Issues
Since GitHub no longer supports password authentication for `git push`, you must use either:

- **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Generate a token and use it instead of your password.
- **SSH Authentication**: Configure SSH keys for secure access. See [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication) for details.
